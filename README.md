# GIS + SQL Ops Analysis (Independent Projects)

This repository contains sample SQL queries used to compute operational KPIs by zone and flag problem areas.
The outputs are designed to pair with QGIS workflows (joining KPI tables to spatial layers for mapping).

## What this shows
- Zone performance KPIs (volume, delivered, on-time %, cancellations)
- “Problem zone” identification using a threshold filter

## Files
- sql/zone_kpis.sql — KPI summary by zone
- sql/problem_zones.sql — filters zones below an on-time threshold (CTE)

## Skills
SQL (CTEs, joins, aggregation) • GIS/QGIS • Spatial analysis workflow support
Window functions • Time-series KPIs • QA checks
